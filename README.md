## VGMDB Plex Metadata Agent

This plugin will allow you to use VGMDB metadata for a Plex music library.

### Installation

- Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/matthewdias/VGMDB.bundle/releases/latest).
- Move `VGMDB.bundle` to your Plex [plugins directory](https://support.plex.tv/articles/201106098-how-do-i-find-the-plug-ins-folder/).
- Restart Plex

### Usage

To use the agent, create a new basic music library in Plex and select VGMDB as the metadata agent. If you want to enable track renaming, enter your Plex token in the agent settings. This will only work for single-disc albums.
